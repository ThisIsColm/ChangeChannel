ðŸ“º Change Channel â€” Batch Fix Audio Channels in Video Proxies
A minimal, native macOS app that batch-converts .mp4 and .mov files to have the correct number of audio channels â€” perfect for fixing proxy relinking issues in Adobe Premiere Pro.

ðŸ”§ Why This Exists

ðŸŽ¯ Choose a target number of audio channels (e.g. 2, 6, 8)

ðŸ“‚ Select a folder of proxy videos

âš¡ Batch convert them using FFmpeg (smartly adds/removes channels)

âœ… Generate relinkable proxies that match original media specs

âœ¨ Features
Drag-and-drop UI

Native macOS .app (bundled with FFmpeg)

Custom audio channel control (1â€“10 channels)

Live FFmpeg console output

Progress tracking and smart file skipping

Minimal, styled dark interface

ðŸš€ Built With
